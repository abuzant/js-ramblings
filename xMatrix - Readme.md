# 🚀 Matrix Mouse Trail Effect with Japanese Characters, Speed Sensitivity & Gravity Burst

## 🔹 Description  
This project is an **interactive Matrix-like mouse trail effect** built using **HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript**. It dynamically generates **glowing text trails** when the mouse moves and features a **gravity-based burst effect** on click. The trail consists of **expanded Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), English letters, and numbers** for a **futuristic cyberpunk effect**.

## 📜 How It Works  
### 1️⃣ Matrix Mouse Trail  
- When the user moves the mouse, random characters appear at the cursor location.  
- The **faster the mouse moves**, the **more characters appear** (speed-sensitive effect).  
- Characters have a **random size & opacity** to enhance realism.  

### 2️⃣ Burst Effect on Click  
- Clicking **triggers 30 characters** at the cursor position.  
- These characters have **gravity applied** and will **fall downward** before fading away.  
- Creates a **beautiful "dropping" effect**, mimicking digital particles.  

### 3️⃣ Character Set (Japanese + English)  
The script includes:  
- **Hiragana (あいうえお...)**  
- **Katakana (カキクケコ...)**  
- **Kanji (零一二三...)**  
- **English letters & numbers (A-Z, 0-9)**  
This makes the effect feel more like a **real digital Matrix environment**.
